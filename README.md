# Speech-to-Text Translator Extravaganza üéâ
Welcome to the coolest speech-to-text translation repo in town! This Python script listens to your golden voice, figures out what language you're speaking, and translates it to your preferred language. It's like a babel fish, but way cooler. We're using the `speech_recognition` library for speech recognition, `langdetect` for language detection, and Hugging Face Transformers for that sweet, sweet translation magic.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Git (optional)

# Gettin' Started üöÄ
1. Clone this bad boy (optional):

```
git clone https://github.com/SweatyCrayfish/speech-recognition-translation.git
```
2. Enter the matrix:
```
cd speech-recognition-translation
```
3. Grab the dependencies like a boss:
```
pip install SpeechRecognition langdetect transformers
```
# Let's Do This üé§
1. Set your native language in the `main()` function by changing the `user_native_language` variable. For example, set it to `en` for English or `fr` for French.
```
user_native_language = 'en'  # Set your language here (e.g., 'en' for English)
```
2. Fire up the script:
```
python speech_recognition_translation.py
```
Speak into the mic when prompted, and let the script work its magic! It'll recognize your speech, detect the language, and translate it to your native language like a pro.
